Landing zone:
to create a single/mutliple accounts in aws

VPC:Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud
----
- no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required
subnet:
=======
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You launch AWS resources,
such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your subnets.

choose one availability zone i.e Data center(create a network in Datacenter)
here subnet is a server
launch instances inside the server

In companies , through VPN connect DataCenter , there is a bridge between datacenter and aws(asw Direct connect)
bastion host:to connect to server,from that server to connect private hosts.
bastillion is a tool----help to trzcking

* login to instances: ssh private ip----unable to connect
* every vpc is a island
to connect between two servers need peer connection to construct a road....
* to clear traffic both sides of the server need routing
To create customized vpc:
========================
1. create VPC
2.create subnet
to connect between two servers need peerconnection(to construct road between them)
to clear traffic between two servers need to connect routetables
add servers both sides and add peerconnection both sides
In routing table peer connection is same on both sides of routing.

Secutiry group:
===============
* A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources
that it is associated with
* associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.
When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group.
inbound rules: Inbound traffic rules control incoming traffic to the instances(coming to your EC2 instances).
==============
* allows SSH traffic to the instances in subnet A from the specified address range(inbound)
outbound rules: outbound rules control outgoing traffic
===============
Outbound traffic rules apply only if the DB instance acts as a client.
For example, outbound traffic rules apply to an Oracle DB instance with outbound database......

connect with mutli-subnets?
==========================
create two subnets if one subnet fails another will clear the trafic(connect)
"visual subnet calculator" : to calculate subnets.
