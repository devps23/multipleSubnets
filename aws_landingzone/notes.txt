what if VM goes down?
If VM goes down then,what is the availability of application:(single server for each component)
==============================================================
site disaster: or hardware can go down
==============
** if one server goes down will use another server....
abc:["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.0/24"]
the above have two subnet servers
Landing zone:
to create a single/mutliple accounts in aws
site disaster:
===============
VPC:Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required
subnet:
=======
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You launch AWS resources,
such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your subnets.

choose one availability zone i.e Data center(create a network in Datacenter)
here subnet is a server
launch instances inside the server

In companies , through VPN connect DataCenter , there is a bridge between datacenter and aws(asw Direct connect)
bastion host:to connect to server,from that server to connect private hosts.
bastillion is a tool----help to trzcking

* login to instances: ssh private ip----unable to connect
* every vpc is a island
to connect between two servers need peer connection to construct a road....
* to clear traffic both sides of the server need routing
To create customized vpc:
========================
1. create VPC
2.create subnet
to connect between two servers need peerconnection(to construct road between them)
to clear traffic between two servers need to connect routetables
add servers both sides and add peerconnection both sides
In routing table peer connection is same on both sides of routing.

Secutiry group:
===============
* A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources
that it is associated with
* associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.
When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group.
inbound rules: Inbound traffic rules control incoming traffic to the instances(coming to your EC2 instances).
==============
* allows SSH traffic to the instances in subnet A from the specified address range(inbound)
outbound rules: outbound rules control outgoing traffic
===============
Outbound traffic rules apply only if the DB instance acts as a client.
For example, outbound traffic rules apply to an Oracle DB instance with outbound database......

connect with mutli-subnets?
==========================
create two subnets if one subnet fails another will clear the trafic(connect)
"visual subnet calculator" : to calculate subnets.
module to module communication:
================================
first module should expose the info
second module will read the info
how first module will expose the info ?
with the help of "outputs" is not for print, expose the info,not print on the screen.

Session:38
==========
In organization , we don't have direct access to the internet? how to run our application without internet?
In Lab how we can do?
How do we get the internet?
there is  a internet,to connect with multiple systems need  a router,through router we can connect
* An Internet Gateway (IGW) is an AWS component that provides a path for network traffic to travel between a
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the public internet. It acts as a bridge between the two networks,
enabling inbound and outbound connections from resources within the VPC.
Network traffic is the amount of data moving across a computer network at any given time
* Internet gateway provides network to subnets(frontend,backend,sql).
once subnets directly connects to Internet gateway it will be a public ip address(like launching an instance in ec2 aws).
so there is no security everyone will access directly.
public subnets should have internet gateway....
public subnets should have a route table......
* so to avoid this "to create NAT Gateway"(it is a wifi router)  has one public ip address and connect to multiple subnets
to split traffic between multiple devices.
* A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC
* NAT gateway is a device
* Public NAT gateways allow servers in your data center to access the Internet.
so NAT gateway has a public ip address , so connect to public ip address and from public ip address to
connect this traffic to multiple subnets.
two natgateways connect to two different subnets
In organisations how to connect the subnets to internet?
========================================================
create a network account---->in that there is a nat gateway connection (wifi router)
to pass  traffic to "translate gateway , through this gateway to allow traffic to multiple subnets
firewall:
=========
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides
whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

* InternetGateway connects(----->) to firewall connects(-------->) to NAT gateway connects(------->) to multiple subnets.
* In big organizations there is one Data centers ,this data centers already connected to the internet
* DataCenters connect to Direct connects connect to NetWork account (Nat Gateway) connects directly to multiple subnets....


1. create an Internet gateway
2. create an natgateway(wifi router)
3.create a public subnets(subnets)
4.association between public subnets and natgateway(connection)

private subnet ----nat gateway
public subnets-----internet gateway
default route is same for all subnets.
for each subnets there is one route table to create
to connect route_table(NAT) to multiple subnets,need association between nat gateway and subnets


1.create public subnets
2.create internet gateway
3.peer connection for all subnets
4.routing for all subnets
5.create route table for all subnets
6.connect route table with internet gateway


aws_route:
==========
Provides a resource to create a routing table entry (a route) in a VPC routing table.
create a routing table entry:to enter routing table(usually a route to a specific network)

aws_route_table:
================
Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table.

every subnet associate with route
so when we create a new route in vpc ,so associate subnets to specific route to clear traffic

aws_eip:
========
eip: elastic ip resource

aws_nat_gateway:
================
The Allocation ID of the Elastic IP address for the NAT Gateway. Required for connectivity_type of public.
* Provides a resource to create a VPC NAT Gateway.
* allocation_id: means that gateway is under public subnets
* subnet_id: means that nat gateway connects to private subnets

aws_internet_gateway:
=====================
Provides a resource to create a VPC Internet Gateway.

1.create a public subnets
2.create a private subnets
3.create an internet gateway
4.create nat gateway
5.create route table
subnets associates to route .so aws_subnet_Associate required to associate route and subnets.
5.public subnet connects to internet gateway
6.private subnets connects to nat gateway
7.need public ip address to connect nat gateway to subnets so that gateway connects to public ip address
public ip address allocates to nat gateway.
8.then nat gateway connects to subnets

*public subnets should have internet gateway access
so add internet gateway ip address
* create nat gateway
